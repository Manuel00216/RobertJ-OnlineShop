/**
 * Database Table Configuration
 * Single source of truth for all Supabase table names.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { DATABASE_TABLES } from "@/constants/database";
 *   supabase.from(DATABASE_TABLES.PRODUCTS)
 *
 * Table names appear only here and in `supabase/migrations/*.sql`. Every query
 * in `lib/supabase/queries.ts` references this constant instead of a literal
 * string, so a table rename is a one-line change instead of a repo-wide
 * find-and-replace, and a typo becomes a compile error instead of a silent
 * runtime "relation does not exist".
