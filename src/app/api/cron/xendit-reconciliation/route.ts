/**
 * Phase #4A: passive reconciliation sweep for Xendit payments left "pending"
 * with nobody left to trigger fix #5A/#5B's synchronous reconciliation — the
 * buyer never returns to retry or cancel, so the attempt would otherwise sit
 * stale forever. Triggered by Vercel Cron (see `vercel.json`); reuses the
 * exact fix #5A/#5B building blocks (`isStaleXenditAttempt`,
 * `reconcileStaleXenditAttempt`) so no payment-status logic is duplicated.
 *
 * This route NEVER creates or charges anything — it only asks Xendit for the
 * real status of an already-finalized attempt and applies it through the
 * same `process_xendit_webhook` RPC the real webhook and fix #5A/#5B use.
 * COD is out of scope by construction: `getStaleXenditPaymentsForReconciliationSweep`
 * only reads `payment_method_type = 'xendit'` rows.
 *
 * TD-9: after the payment-status sweep above, a second pass auto-expires
 * orders that are still unpaid 24h after placement — see `runExpirySweep`.
 * Deliberately the SAME cron/route (not a second scheduled job): daily
 * granularity is more than enough for a 24h threshold, and it means one
 * schedule to reason about instead of two.
