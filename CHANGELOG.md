# Changelog

All notable changes to RoberJ Online Shop are documented here, newest first. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> The project has not reached a versioned `1.0` release, so entries are grouped by date rather than semantic version. Historical entries below are reconstructed from migration timestamps and existing planning docs — they mark when work **landed**, not when this changelog was created. Going forward, every PR that ships a module milestone, a schema change, or a business-facing behavior change should add an entry here in the same PR (see [CONTRIBUTING.md → Documentation update requirements](./CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-update-requirements)).

## [Unreleased]

### Known gaps (tracked, not resolved)
- `recommendation_rules` table not yet implemented (Guided Product Selection — Phase 9).
- No automated test runner (see `DECISIONS.md` → ADR-015).

Full current-vs-target status: [README.md → Implementation Status](./README.md#implementation-status-target-vs-current) · [ARCHITECTURE.md → Technical Debt Register](./ARCHITECTURE.md#technical-debt-register).

## 2026-08-13 — Reports & analytics (Phase 8)

### Added
- Reports module: `/dashboard/reports` for Shop Owners (own shop) and the Administrator
  (platform-wide, with an admin-only shop filter). KPI cards (revenue, orders, paid orders, avg
  order value, units, cancelled), a sales-over-time trend (day/week/month), an order-status
  breakdown, a COD-vs-QR paid-payment split, top products, and a low/out-of-stock report. Date-range
  presets + explicit range + granularity, plus CSV export.
- Four read-only `SECURITY DEFINER` aggregation RPCs — `report_sales_summary`,
  `report_sales_timeseries`, `report_order_status_breakdown`, `report_top_products` —
  (`20260818000000_reports_analytics_rpcs.sql`). Each re-enforces scoping internally (seller →
  own orders; admin → all, or one shop via `p_shop_id`; a seller's `p_shop_id` is ignored), with
  `EXECUTE` granted to `authenticated` only. **No `reports` table** was modelled — resolves TD-5.
- Reports service section in `queries.ts` (`getSalesSummary`/`getSalesTimeseries`/
  `getOrderStatusBreakdown`/`getTopProducts`, plus `getLowStockReport` reusing the existing
  RLS-scoped inventory read), a new `features/reports/` module, and hand-rolled dependency-free
  charts in `src/components/charts` (`TrendChart`, `BarChart`).
- Two additive `orders` indexes (`orders_seller_placed_idx`, `orders_placed_at_idx`) for
  date-range scans. `scripts/e2e-reports.mjs` asserts the RPCs reject anonymous callers.

### Design notes
- **Single date axis:** every metric buckets on `placed_at` in `Asia/Manila`. Revenue counts only
  orders with `payment_status = 'paid'` (the confirmed-revenue source of truth for both COD and QR);
  `payments.amount_cents` is never summed directly. See `DECISIONS.md` → ADR-016.
- No existing Orders/Payments/Products/Inventory/RLS behaviour was changed — the migration is purely
  additive (new functions + indexes).

## 2026-08-07 — Payments: QR receipt upload + manual verification (Phase 7)

### Added
- The SAD's target payment path is now fully implemented: COD (unchanged) and QR Transfer (new).
  A buyer selects QR at checkout (informational only — `create_order` is deliberately unchanged),
  then uploads a receipt from their order detail page (`submitQrPaymentAction`) once they've sent
  payment via the seller's own receiving QR code (new `profiles.payment_qr_url`, seller-editable
  via the existing `ProfileForm`). The order's seller (or an admin) verifies or rejects it from a
  new minimal `/dashboard/payments` page — the **first real page** under `/dashboard`.
- `submit_qr_payment`/`verify_payment` `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs — the sole write path into
  `payments`, mirroring `create_order`'s chokepoint pattern (no direct INSERT/UPDATE grant on the
  table). A narrow, in-place fix to `enforce_order_update_rules` lets a seller move their own
  order's `payment_status` from `pending` to `paid`/`failed` (previously admin-only), matching the
  SAD's "Administrator **or** Shop Owner" language.
- The `payment-receipts` Supabase Storage bucket — the **first Storage feature in this repo**.
  Private, RLS-gated via a subquery against `orders` (buyer/seller/admin of that order), path
  convention `{order_id}/{uuid}.{ext}` (deliberately not buyer-id-in-path, to avoid a spoofable
  policy).
- New `features/payments/` module (actions, schemas, types, components) and
  `PAYMENTS: "payments"` added to `DATABASE_TABLES`.

### Changed
- `payments` table evolved: Stripe-only columns (`provider`, `provider_transaction_id`,
  `stripe_event_id`, `charge_id`, `customer_id`, `customer_email`) dropped — **resolves TD-3**.
  `receipt_url` renamed to `receipt_path` (a private Storage object path, not a public URL).
  Added `verified_by`/`verified_at` (manual-verification audit trail). `payment_method_type` gains
  `qr_upload` (`card` stays as inert legacy).
- `database.types.ts` (hand-written — TD-8) updated to match.

### Migrations
- `20260807010000_evolve_payments_for_qr.sql`, `20260807020000_qr_payment_rpcs.sql`,
  `20260807030000_payment_receipts_storage.sql`, `20260807040000_profiles_payment_qr_url.sql`.

## 2026-08-07 — Checkout audit fixes & Stripe spike retirement

### Fixed
- `checkout.schema.ts`: the optional `phone` field rejected the empty string it defaults to (regex validation ran on `""` since the field is never actually `undefined`), blocking checkout for anyone who left it blank. Now matches `account.schema.ts`'s `.or(z.literal(""))` pattern.

### Added
- Order-confirmation page (`/checkout/confirmation`) — full checkout success now hands off to a summary of the order(s) just placed instead of the raw order-history list.
- Shipping address "Country" is now locked to Philippines (domestic-only marketplace, no courier/shipping API), enforced both in the UI and server-side (`z.literal(...)`).

### Removed
- The Stripe/card payment spike (`DECISIONS.md` → ADR-014, now retired): `stripe.actions.ts`, `StripePaymentFlow.tsx`, `lib/stripe.ts`, `scripts/e2e-stripe.mjs`, the `stripe`/`@stripe/*` npm packages, and the Stripe env vars. Audit found it had no webhook to ever move `payment_status` out of `pending` — a "successful" card payment never actually recorded as paid — so retiring it outright was safer than building the missing webhook for unsanctioned scope. Checkout is COD-only until the target QR-upload path (ADR-008) ships. The `payments` table's Stripe-specific columns remain in the schema pending a dedicated cleanup migration (TD-3).

### Changed
- Documented the checkout total's single-currency (PHP-only) assumption inline (`CheckoutForm.tsx`) rather than implementing multi-currency conversion — this marketplace is domestic/single-market by design.

## 2026-08-06 — Documentation baseline

### Added
- `README.md` rewritten as the AI-optimized business front door (vision, scope, roles, roadmap, folder map).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — technical specification, target/current schema mapping, RBAC and flow diagrams.
- `CLAUDE.md` extended with AI/developer working agreement, standards, and non-negotiables (preserving the existing `@AGENTS.md` import).
- `.env.example` added, matching `src/config/env.ts`.

---

## 2026-08-04 — Payments spike & security hardening

### Added
- `payments` table + `payment_method_type` enum (migration `20260804000200_add_payments.sql`).
- Stripe integration (`stripe.actions.ts`, `lib/stripe.ts`, `scripts/e2e-stripe.mjs`) — **provisional spike**, not the SAD's official payment path (see `DECISIONS.md` → ADR-014).
- `get_my_profile()` `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC (migration `20260804000100_add_get_my_profile.sql`).

### Fixed
- Restored correct column-level grants on `profiles` after a prior migration re-leaked `phone` via full-row SELECT (migration `20260804000000_restore_profiles_column_grants.sql`).
- Restricted `create_order` RPC execution to `authenticated` only, revoking anonymous execute (migration `20260804000300_revoke_create_order_anon_execute.sql`).

---

## 2026-08-03 — Landing page & storefront

### Added
- Landing page implementation completed per `landing-page-implementation-plan.md` — Hero, Featured Products, Featured Shops (placeholder), Marketplace Features, category browsing.
- `(marketing)` / `(shop)` route-group split.
- `features/landing` and `features/categories` service layers.

---

## 2026-08-02 — Foundation

### Added
- Initial database schema: `profiles`, `categories`, `products`, `product_images`, `orders`, `order_items` (migration `20260802000100_initial_schema.sql`), with full RLS from day one.
- `create_order` atomic checkout RPC, `handle_new_user` auto-provisioning trigger, order lifecycle triggers.
- Supabase client layer (`client.ts`, `server.ts`, `session.ts`) and centralized service layer (`queries.ts`).
- `src/proxy.ts` — Next.js 16 session refresh + route protection.
- Authentication module (sign up/in/out, password reset, email verification via PKCE).
- RLS audit remediation pass (migrations `20260802160000_security_hardening.sql`, `20260803000100_rls_hardening.sql`).
