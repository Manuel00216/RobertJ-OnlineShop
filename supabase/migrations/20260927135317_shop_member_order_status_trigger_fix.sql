-- =============================================================================
-- Correction discovered during Phase 1-3 verification: enforce_order_update_rules
-- (the orders BEFORE UPDATE trigger governing fulfilment-status transitions)
-- has its own explicit v_uid <> old.seller_id guard, entirely independent of
-- RLS and untouched by the earlier RLS-widening migration. Without this fix,
-- a reassigned shop member could read a shop's orders but could never
-- advance their status (pack/ship/deliver) — breaking record_order_shipment
-- and advanceOrderStatus's direct order_status updates alike, since both
-- ultimately hit this same trigger. Widened the same way as every other
-- guard in this phase: add an is_shop_member(old.shop_id) OR-branch,
-- everything else byte-identical to the live definition.
